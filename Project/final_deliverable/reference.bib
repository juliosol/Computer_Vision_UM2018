abstract="A general approach to solving a problem consists in reducing it to another problem for which a solution can be found. The first section in this chapter is an example of this approach for the zero-finding problem. Yet, in most occurrences of this strategy, this auxiliary problem is different from the original one, as in the reduction of a nonlinear problem to one or more linear ones. In contrast with this, the treatment we consider reduces the situation at hand to the consideration of a number of instances of the same problem with different data. The key remark is that for these instances, either we know the corresponding solution or we can compute it with little effort.",
